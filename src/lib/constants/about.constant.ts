  "As a computer engineering student, I am focused on learning various aspects of programming, development, and technology management. My major allows me to gain a deeper understanding of how computing systems work, from computer architecture to complex software solutions. My studies emphasize frontend development, which allows me to combine my technical knowledge with a creative approach to designing user interfaces. I actively study languages and technologies such as JavaScript and everything related to it, as well as popular frameworks such as React, Next.js, Nest.js, which helps me to effectively develop modern web applications.",
  "In addition, I am familiar with testing processes, which helps me build quality and reliable products. I apply various testing methods, from unit tests to integration testing, to make sure that my projects run stable and bug-free. By now, I have experience developing 6-7 in-house projects that range from small web applications to larger, more complex systems. These projects have not only helped me deepen my knowledge, but also taught me how to work efficiently with code and solve problems."
